# Synchronization Walkthrough

I have synchronized the project files and the brain context with your Windows environment.

## Changes Made

### Project Context (Brain)
- Created a `.brain/` directory in the repository root.
- Copied artifacts from the local Mac brain folders:
    - `768b7ca2-7cab-48ce-a589-24d01b7b2843`
    - `f64f7c92-4591-4f8a-9880-b2f47a912b56`
- Committed and pushed these changes to [JoaoLima0710/tutor-music](https://github.com/JoaoLima0710/tutor-music.git).

## How to Synchronize on Windows

1. Open your terminal or git client on Windows.
2. Navigate to your local `tutor-music` repository.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
4. All synchronization artifacts will be available in the `.brain/` folder.

## Verification Results

- `git push` completed successfully:
    ```
    To https://github.com/JoaoLima0710/tutor-music.git
       9515105..432461b  main -> main
    ```
- All `.md` artifacts from the current and previous sessions are included in the repository.

## Bug Fix: Audio Resilience Error

I fixed a critical runtime error that was preventing the application from loading (`TypeError: audioResilienceService.getFailureHistory is not a function`).

### Fix Details
- Added missing methods `getFailureHistory` and `clearFailureHistory` to `AudioResilienceService.ts`.
- Verified the fix locally on `localhost:3000`.

### Verification
- The application now loads successfully.
- No console errors are reported.

## Bug Fix: Duplicate Import Error

I fixed a build error caused by a duplicate import in `MajorMinorChordTraining.tsx`.

### Fix Details
- Removed the second `import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card';` at line 15.
- The component now compiles correctly.
